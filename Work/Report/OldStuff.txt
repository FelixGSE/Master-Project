Decision-making is a cognitive process of selecting an option from a set of possible alternatives based on certain criteria \cite{Wang2007}. When analysing decision-making as a continuous process of interaction with the environment, learning becomes an important aspect. Due to their cognitive ability, mental and psychological status people should show different learning behaviour.\\
In \textit{supervised learning} data are predicted by training a classifier based on examples. The identity of observations in the training sample is known. This is used to connect patterns in the data with corresponding labels of observations. In contrast to that in \textit{unsupervised learning} we don't know the ground truth. The objective is to discover natural clustering behaviour in the data itself and group objects into subsets, such that objects in those subsets are more closely related to each other \cite[page 9 et. seqq.]{Murphy2012} and \cite[page 501 et. seqq.]{hastie}. A vast class of clustering algorithms based on different approaches are proposed in the literature (e.g. hierarchical and optimization based clustering). This paper investigates, whether such unsupervised learning techniques can be used in the context of human decision making process to identify latent grouping. The decision making process is studied by monitoring peoples sequential choices in a controlled experiment environments over time. Thus, this paper operates in the intersection of machine learning and cognitive science. To our knowledge this particular setting has not been studied before.\\
We approach our research in the following way. We first set up a reinforcement learning based simulation framework to study theoretical boundaries of several clustering techniques and when they are applicable.
 Subsequently, we test our chosen methods on several  real experimental data sets. Corresponding to our simulation framework we first apply clustering algorithms to data from controlled n-armed bandit experiment.\footnote{A detailed introduction is given in section \ref{reinf}} A widely used approach to study human decision making process is the \textit{Iowa gambling task}, where participants try maximize rewards by choosing cards from different decks with different reward structures.\footnote{There are existing several slightly different versions of test. \cite{Steingroever2015} provides a data collection for from several sources giving a broad overview of different variations of the test.} Within this framework we analyse two different data sets. First we study decision making behaviour from people with different criminal profiles. Furthermore, we use another data set from cocaine abusers.\\

The report has the following structure. In section two we provide a short overview on related literature in the field. Section three is dedicated to the theoretical foundation and the simulation. We first provide knowledge of reinforcement and line out our experiment design in more detail. This section also includes an overview of applied algorithms, similarity and distance concepts. A mathematical formulation of the applied algorithms, similarity measures and cluster evaluation techniques can be found in the appendix.\footnote{Since our data are fairly small we will not discuss complexity of the algorithms.} Finally, we study their simulation performance and try to identify parameter settings, where they are applicable.\\ 
The rest of paper is address clustering our experimental data. We keep the scope of this paper tight and thus there some questions have to be left open. Thus we dedicated another section to discussing some possible extensions. We close this paper with a final summary of our results.


\subsection{Huntington Data}

\cite{Stout2001} conducted research on behaviour of patients with Huntington disease (HD) and Parkinson disease (PD).\footnote{The Huntington Disease is an illness of the central nervous system. The are are a wide range of associated symptoms including physical symptoms like uncontrollable muscular movements and clumsiness and psychological symptoms like minored concentration, short term memory lapses etc . Moreover a related possible symptom is Parkinson disease \cite{hunt}. Parkinson is chronic and progressive movement  disorder. Also Parkinson goes along with physical, such as tremors and rigidity and psychological symptoms, such as memory problems, minored speed of thinking fear and anxiety (among others) \cite{parc}} 
In the study there were considered 14 participants with HD and 22 participants with PD. They participants are required to don't have ongoing drug problems (including alcohol), free of other major diseases (physical or psychological nature). A group of 33 people serves as a control group. This group can further distinguished in younger (YHC) and older control participants (OHC). Table \ref{tab:hus} gives a basic summary of the demographic of the participants.
