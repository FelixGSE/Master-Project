abstract = {Use of traditional k-mean type algorithm is limited to numeric data. This paper presents a clustering algorithm based on k-mean paradigm that works well for data with mixed numeric and categorical features. We propose new cost function and distance measure based on co-occurrence of values. The measures also take into account the significance of an attribute towards the clustering process. We present a modified description of cluster center to overcome the numeric data only limitation of k-mean algorithm and provide a better characterization of clusters. The performance of this algorithm has been studied on real world data sets. Comparisons with other clustering algorithms illustrate the effectiveness of this approach. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {It is a hallmark of a good model to make accurate a priori predictions to new conditions (Busemeyer {\&} Wang, 2000). This study compared 8 decision learning models with respect to their generalizability. Participants performed 2 tasks (the Iowa Gambling Task and the Soochow Gambling Task), and each model made a priori predictions by estimating the parameters for each participant from 1 task and using those same parameters to predict on the other task. Three methods were used to evaluate the models at the individual level of analysis. The first method used a post hoc fit criterion, the second method used a generalization criterion for short-term predictions, and the third method again used a generalization criterion for long-term predictions. The results suggest that the models with the prospect utility function can make generalizable predictions to new conditions, and different learning models are needed for making short-versus long-term predictions on simple gambling tasks.},

abstract = {Deciding advantageously in a complex situation is thought to require overt reasoning on declarative knowledge, namely, on facts pertaining to premises, options for action, and outcomes of actions that embody the pertinent previous experience. An alternative pos- sibility was investigated: that overt reasoning is preceded by a nonconscious biasing step that uses neural systems other than those that support declarative knowledge. Normal participants and patients with prefrontal damage and decision-making defects performed a gambling task in which behavioral, psychophysiological, and self-account measures were obtained in parallel. Normals began to choose advantageously before they realized which strategy worked best, whereas prefrontal patients continued to choose disadvan- tageously even after they knew the correct strategy. Moreover, normals began to generate anticipatory skin conductance responses (SCRs) whenever they pondered a choice that turned out to be risky, before they knew explicitly that it was a risky choice, whereas patients never developed anticipatory SCRs, although some eventually realized which choices were risky. The results suggest that, in normal individuals, nonconscious biases guide behavior before conscious knowledge does. Without the help of such biases, overt knowledge may be insufficient to ensure advantageous behavior.},

The major limitation of these proximity measures is that they are based on the closeness of the values regardless of the similarity w.r.t. the growth behavior of the time series. To alleviate this drawback we propose a new dissimilarity index, based on an automatic adaptive tuning function, to include both proximity measures w.r.t. values and w.r.t. behavior.

Time series of this type are frequent in health care, where they represent the health trajectories of individuals. The problem is challenging because categorical variables make it difficult to define a meaningful distance between trajectories. We propose an approach based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), where we first map each trajectory into an HMM, then define a suitable distance between HMMs and finally proceed to cluster the HMMs with a method based on a distance matrix. We test our approach on a simulated, but realistic, data set of 1,255 trajectories of individuals of age 45 and over, on a synthetic validation set with known clustering structure, and on a smaller set of 268 trajectories extracted from the longitudinal Health and Retirement Survey. The proposed method can be implemented quite simply using standard packages in R and Matlab and may be a good candidate for solving the difficult problem of clustering multivariate time series with categorical variables using tools that do not require advanced statistic knowledge, and therefore are accessible to a wide range of researchers.},

We begin by review- ing a well-known measure of partition correspondence often attributed to Rand (1971), discuss the issue of correcting this index for chance, and note that a recent normalization strategy developed by Morey and Agresti (1984) and adopted by others (e.g., Milligan and Cooper 1985) is based on an incorrect assumption. Then, the general problem of comparing partitions is approached indirectly by assessing the congruence of two proximity matrices using a simple cross-product measure. They are generated from cOrrespond- ing partitions using various scoring rules. Special cases derivable include traditionally familiar statistics and/or ones tailored to weight certain object pairs differentially. Finally, we propose a measure based on the comparison of object triples having the advantage of a probabilistic interpretation in addi- tion to being corrected for chance (i.e., assuming a constant value under a reasonable null hypothesis) and bounded between -4-I},

abstract = {Time series are ubiquitous, and a measure to assess their similarity is a core part of many computational systems. In particular, the similarity measure is the most essential ingredient of time series clustering and classification systems. Because of this importance, countless approaches to estimate time series similarity have been proposed. However, there is a lack of comparative studies using empirical, rigorous, quantitative, and large-scale assessment strategies. In this article, we provide an extensive evaluation of similarity measures for time series classification following the aforementioned principles. We consider 7 different measures coming from alternative measure 'families', and 45 publicly-available time series data sets coming from a wide variety of scientific domains. We focus on out-of-sample classification accuracy, but in-sample accuracies and parameter choices are also discussed. Our work is based on rigorous evaluation methodologies and includes the use of powerful statistical significance tests to derive meaningful conclusions. The obtained results show the equivalence, in terms of accuracy, of a number of measures, but with one single candidate outperforming the rest. Such findings, together with the followed methodology, invite researchers on the field to adopt a more consistent evaluation criteria and a more informed decision regarding the baseline measures to which new developments should be compared. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Decision-making deficits in clinical populations are often studied using the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Performance on the IGT can be decomposed in its constituent psychological processes by means of cognitive modeling analyses. However, conclusions about the hypothesized psychological processes are valid only if the model provides an adequate account of the data. In this article, we systematically assessed absolute model performance of the Expectancy Valence (EV) model, the Prospect Valence Learning (PVL) model, and a hybrid version of both models—the PVL-Delta model—using 2 different methods. These methods assess (a) whether a model provides an acceptable fit to an observed choice pattern, and (b) whether the parameters obtained from model fitting can be used to generate the observed choice pattern. Our results show that all models provided an acceptable fit to 2 stylized data sets; however, when the model parameters were used to generate choices, only the PVL-Delta model captured the qualitative patterns in the data. These findings were confirmed by fitting the models to 5 published IGT data sets. Our results highlight that a model's ability to fit a particular choice pattern does not guarantee that the model can also generate that same choice pattern. Future applications of RL models should carefully assess absolute model performance to avoid premature conclusions about the psychological processes that drive performance on the IGT.},

abstract = {Information theoretic measures form a fundamental class of measures for comparing clusterings, and have recently received increasing interest. Nevertheless, a number of questions concerning their properties and inter-relationships remain unresolved. In this paper, we perform an organized study of information theoretic measures for clustering comparison, including several existing popular measures in the literature, as well as some newly proposed ones. We discuss and prove their important properties, such as the metric property and the normalization property. We then highlight to the clustering community the importance of correcting information theoretic measures for chance, especially when the data size is small compared to the number of clusters present therein. Of the available information theoretic based measures, we advocate the normalized information distance (NID) as a general measure of choice, for it possesses concurrently several important properties, such as being both a metric and a normalized measure, admitting an exact analytical adjusted-for-chance form, and using the nominal [0,1] range better than other normalized variants.},

abstract = {Using a novel quantitative model of repeated choice behavior, we investigated the cognitive processes of criminal offenders incarcerated for various crimes. Eighty-one criminals, including violent offenders, drug and sex offenders, drivers operating a vehicle while impaired, and 18 matched controls were tested. The results were also contrasted with those obtained from neurological patients with focal brain lesions in the orbitofrontal cortex and from drug abusers. Participants performed the computerized version of the Iowa gambling task (Bechara, Damasio, Damasio, {\&} Anderson, 1994), and the results were decomposed into specific component processes, using the expectancy valence model (Busemeyer {\&} Stout, 2002). The findings indicated that whereas all the criminal groups tended to select disadvantageously, the cognitive profiles exhibited by different groups were considerably different. Certain subpopulations—most significantly, drug and sex offenders—overweighted po- tential gains as compared with losses, similar to chronic cocaine abusers. In contrast, assault/murder criminals tended to make less consistent choices and to focus on immediate outcomes and, in these respects, were more similar to patients with orbitofrontal damage. The present cognitive model provides a novel way for building a bridge between cognitive neuroscience and complex human behaviors.},

@article{Shannon1948,
	abstract = {The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has intensified the interest in a general theory of communication. A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartley on this subject. In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information. The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. If the number of messages in the set is finite then this number or any monotonic function of this number can be regarded as a measure of the information produced when one message is chosen from the set, all choices being equally likely. As was pointed out by Hartley the most natural choice is the logarithmic function. Although this definition must be generalized considerably when we consider the influence of the statistics of the message and when we have a continuous range of messages, we will in all cases use an essentially logarithmic measure.},

It expects familiarity with calculus, probability theory, and linear algebra as taught in a rst- or secondyear undergraduate course on mathematics for scientists and engineers. Conventional courses on information theory cover not only the beautiful theoretical ideas of Shannon, but also practical solutions to communication problems. This book goes further, bringing in Bayesian data modelling, Monte Carlo methods, variational methods, clustering algorithms, and neural networks. Why unify information theory and machine learning? Because they are two sides of the same coin. In the 1960s, a single eld, cybernetics, was populated by information theorists, computer scientists, and neuroscientists, all studying common problems. Information theory and machine learning still belong together. Brains are the ultimate compression and communication systems. And the state-of-the-art algorithms for both data compression and error-correcting codes use the same tools as machine learning.},

We begin by review- ing a well-known measure of partition correspondence often attributed to Rand (1971), discuss the issue of correcting this index for chance, and note that a recent normalization strategy developed by Morey and Agresti (1984) and adopted by others (e.g., Milligan and Cooper 1985) is based on an incorrect assumption. Then, the general problem of comparing partitions is approached indirectly by assessing the congruence of two proximity matrices using a simple cross-product measure. They are generated from cOrrespond- ing partitions using various scoring rules. Special cases derivable include traditionally familiar statistics and/or ones tailored to weight certain object pairs differentially. Finally, we propose a measure based on the comparison of object triples having the advantage of a probabilistic interpretation in addi- tion to being corrected for chance (i.e., assuming a constant value under a reasonable null hypothesis) and bounded between -4-I},

	abstract = {Asperger's disorder (ASP), like other autism spectrum disorders, is associated with altered responsiveness to social stimuli. This study investigated learning and responsiveness to nonsocial, but motivational, stimuli in ASP. We examined choice behavior and galvanic skin conductance responses (SCRs) during the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT; Bechara et al., 1994) in 15 adolescents and young adults with ASP and 14 comparison subjects. We examined aspects of learning, attention to wins and losses, and response style with a formal cognitive model, the Expectancy-Valence Learning model (Busemeyer {\&} Stout, 2002). The ASP group did not differ from the comparison group in proportions of selections from advantageous decks. However, ASP participants showed a distinct pattern of selection characterized by frequent shifts between the four IGT decks, whereas comparison participants developed clear deck preferences. SCR results showed some evidence of reduced responsiveness in the ASP group during the IGT. Results from the cognitive model indicated that, in contrast to the comparison group, the ASP group's selections were less consistent with the motivational significance they assigned to decks. Findings are discussed in the context of the neurobiological substrates associated with IGT performance.},

	abstract = {Background: Limited data are available about the validity of the diagnosis of pathological gambling (PG) and about the etiology and the efficacy of different treatment strategies of this disorder; however, similarities in decision-making behavior between PG patients and patients with ventromedial prefrontal cortex lesions suggest a possible implication of these areas in the pathophysiology of this disorder, as in obsessive-compulsive disorder, in which the decision-making impairment is significantly associated with response to serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment. Nevertheless, several studies have shown that decision-making functioning is also impaired in drug-addicted patients who have shown abnormalities in ventromedial prefrontal cortex during functional neuroimaging studies. Methods: We assessed the decision-making function mediated by the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in 20 PG patients and 40 healthy control (HC) subjects using the Gambling Task, which simulates real-life decision-making, testing the ability to balance immediate rewards against long-term negative consequence. Results: Significant differences were found in Gambling Task performance between HC subjects and PG patients, who showed a specific decision-making profile across the sequence of the game. The dissimilarity does not appear to depend on the basic cognitive function deficit of the PG group. Conclusions: These data seem to suggest the existence of a link between PG and other disorders (i.e., obsessive-compulsive disorder and drug addiction) all having diminished ability to evaluate future consequences, which may be explained at least in part by an abnormal functioning of the orbitofrontal cortex. ?? 2002 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

Building on this evidence, we assessed the performance of a group of 34 OCD patients on a measure indexing with orbitofrontal cortex functioning and compared it with the performance of two other subject groups, one consisting of 34 healthy control subjects and the other 16 patients with panic disorder. All study subjects performed a neuropsychological task, which is sensitive to frontal lobe dysfunction and simulating real-life decision-making. Significant differences were found between the neuropsychological profiles of the OCD and of other groups, pointing to a possible specificity of decision-making deficit in OCD. Comparison of the performance of the OCD patients grouped according to response to antiobsessive drug treatment showed that poor neuropsychological task performance predicted poor outcome of pharmacological treatment. Task behavior did not correlate with severity of illness or demographic characteristics of the subjects. Results support the role of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in OCD.},

	abstract = {Negative symptoms have been associated with frontal lobe dysfunction in schizophrenia. However, neuropsychological studies that evaluated the correlation between performance in tests sensitive to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and negative symptoms have shown inconsistent results. Growing evidence has appeared that not only the DLPFC but other prefrontal regions could be involved in schizophrenia. We evaluated schizophrenic patients and healthy controls using three "frontal tests": the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), the Iowa Gambling Task (GT) and a Theory of Mind test (Faux Pas), and studied the relationship between performance in these tests and negative symptomatology. Schizophrenic patients had worse performance than normal controls on the WCST, GT and Faux Pas test. The severity of the negative symptoms showed a moderate to high correlation with performance in the Faux Pas test. Our findings support the idea that different prefrontal regions could be affected in people with schizophrenia and that the damage to each of these regions could be, at least in part, independent of the damage to the others. Some negative symptoms could be associated with frontal medial cortex dysfunction. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Computational models of the psychological processes underlying this impairment have the potential to provide a rich description of the psychological characteristics of poor performers within particular clinical groups. We used two computational models of IGT performance, the Expectancy Valence Learning model (EVL) and the Prospect Valence Learning model (PVL), to assess motivational, memory, and response processes in 17 chronic cannabis abusers and 15 control participants. Model comparison and simulation methods revealed that the PVL model explained the observed data better than the EVL model. Results indicated that cannabis abusers tended to be under-influenced by loss magnitude, treating each loss as a constant and minor negative outcome regardless of the size of the loss. In addition, they were more influenced by gains, and made decisions that were less consistent with their expectancies relative to non-using controls. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Substance abusers are characterized by hypersensitivity to reward. This leads to maladaptive decisions generally, as well as those on laboratory-based decision-making tasks, such as the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Negative affect has also been shown to disrupt the decision-making of healthy individuals, particularly decisions made under uncertainty. Neuropsychological theories of learning, including the Somatic Marker Hypothesis (SMH), argue this occurs by amplifying affective responses to punishment. In substance abusers, this might serve to rebalance their sensitivity to reward with punishment, and improve decision-making. Methods: Before completing the IGT, 45 heavy and 47 light drinkers were randomly assigned to a control condition, or led to believe they had to give a stressful public speech. IGT performance was analyzed with the Expectancy-Valence (EV) learning model. Working memory and IQ were also assessed. Results: Heavy drinkers made more disadvantageous decisions than light drinkers, due to higher attention to gains (versus losses) on the IGT. Anticipatory stress increased participants' attention to losses, significantly improving heavy drinkers' decision-making. Conclusions: Anticipatory stress increased attention to losses, effectively restoring decision-making deficits in heavy drinkers by rebalancing their reward sensitivity with punishment sensitivity. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Abnormalities in incentive decision making, typically assessed using the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), have been reported in both schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD). We applied the Expectancy–Valence (E–V) model to determine whether motivational, cognitive and response selection component processes of IGT performance are differentially affected in SZ and BD. Method: Performance on the IGT was assessed in 280 individuals comprising 70 remitted patients with SZ, 70 remitted patients with BD and 140 age-, sex- and IQ-matched healthy individuals. Based on the E–V model, we extracted three parameters, ‘attention to gains or loses', ‘expectancy learning' and ‘response consistency', that respectively reflect motivational, cognitive and response selection influences on IGT performance. Results: Both patient groups underperformed in the IGT compared to healthy individuals. However, the source of these deficits was diagnosis specific. Associative learning underlying the representation of expectancies was disrupted in SZ whereas BD was associated with increased incentive salience of gains. These findings were not attributable to non-specific effects of sex, IQ, psychopathology or medication. Conclusions: Our results point to dissociable processes underlying abnormal incentive decision making in BD and SZ that could potentially be mapped to different neural circuits.

	abstract = {Decision-making deficits in clinical populations are often studied using the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Performance on the IGT can be decomposed in its constituent psychological processes by means of cognitive modeling analyses. However, conclusions about the hypothesized psychological processes are valid only if the model provides an adequate account of the data. In this article, we systematically assessed absolute model performance of the Expectancy Valence (EV) model, the Prospect Valence Learning (PVL) model, and a hybrid version of both models—the PVL-Delta model—using 2 different methods. These methods assess (a) whether a model provides an acceptable fit to an observed choice pattern, and (b) whether the parameters obtained from model fitting can be used to generate the observed choice pattern. Our results show that all models provided an acceptable fit to 2 stylized data sets; however, when the model parameters were used to generate choices, only the PVL-Delta model captured the qualitative patterns in the data. These findings were confirmed by fitting the models to 5 published IGT data sets. Our results highlight that a model's ability to fit a particular choice pattern does not guarantee that the model can also generate that same choice pattern. Future applications of RL models should carefully assess absolute model performance to avoid premature conclusions about the psychological processes that drive performance on the IGT.},

Participants performed 2 tasks (the Iowa Gambling Task and the Soochow Gambling Task), and each model made a priori predictions by estimating the parameters for each participant from 1 task and using those same parameters to predict on the other task. Three methods were used to evaluate the models at the individual level of analysis. The first method used a post hoc fit criterion, the second method used a generalization criterion for short-term predictions, and the third method again used a generalization criterion for long-term predictions. The results suggest that the models with the prospect utility function can make generalizable predictions to new conditions, and different learning models are needed for making short-versus long-term predictions on simple gambling tasks.},

abstract = {Decision making is one of the basic cognitive processes of human behaviors by which a preferred option or a course of actions is chosen from among a set of alternatives based on certain criteria. Decision theories are widely applied in many disciplines encompassing cognitive informatics, computer science, management science, economics, sociology, psychology, political science, and statistics. A number of decision strategies have been proposed from different angles and applica- tion domains such as the maximum expected utility and Bayesian method. However, there is still a lack of a fundamental and mathematical decision model and a rigorous cognitive process for decision making. This article presents a fundamental cognitive decision making process and its mathematical model, which is described as a sequence of Cartesian-product based selections. A rigorous description of the decision process in real-time process algebra (RTPA) is provided. Real-world decisions are perceived as a repetitive application of the fundamental cognitive process. The result shows that all categories of decision strategies fit in the formally described decision process. The cognitive process of decision making may be applied in a wide range of decision-based systems such as cognitive informatics, software agent systems, expert systems, and decision support systems.},
