## Eskin Similarity/measure

The Eskin measure was proposed by Eskin et al. (2002). Its basic idea is to assign higher weights to mismatches by variables with the higher number of categories. The similarity between two objects for the c-th variable is then expressed as 

[insert formula] 

where nc is a number of categories of the c-th variable. Equation (2) can be used for computation of the similarity between two objects. The dissimilarity measure is computed as 

[insert formula]

The inverse occurrence frequency (IOF) treats mismatches of more frequent categories by lower weights, i.e. 

[insert formula]

where f(xic) expresses a frequency of the value xic of the c-th variable. The similarity and dissimilarity measure can be computed by using Equations (2) and (5). The



## Lin Similarity/measure

The Lin measure, which was introduced by Lin (1998), assigns higher weights to more
frequent categories in case of matches and lower weights to less frequent categories in case of mismatches, i.e.

[insert formula]

where p(xic) expresses a relative frequency of the value xic of the c-th variable. The similarity measure between two objects is computed as

[insert formula]

and the dissimilarity measure according to Equation (5).




############################################# Literature review

This paper explores a pioneering approach in analysing individual behaviour in the context of the Iowa Gambling Task. Papers xyz used expectancy valence model and identified different clusters based on three behavioural parameters. There are many/several choices of discrete data similarity measures, among the less known ones we considered xyz.

The literature used in this paper can be split in two groups, one exploring individual behaviour difference using IGT and SGT and the second group containing papers about similarity measures and unsupervised methods. Our starting point was the research done by Eldad Yechiam who through several papers explored decision making of individuals with various potential social impairments(difficulties).
Yechiam(2005)(et al?) evaluates different decision behaviour between 10 different populations of drug abusers. Their model successfully identifies and distinguishes several of these subgroups. Same method was used for the criminals dataset used in this paper. We explored several similarity/distance measures and multiple clustering methods.

There exists a rich literature on identifying behavioural groups using the Iowa Gambling Task experiment. It has been shown that individuals with prefrontal brain damage and decision-making defects continue to choose disadvantageously even after they learned the optimal strategy.(Bechera et al., 1997). Several studies identify specific drug-user groups, e.g. cocaine addicts (Stout et al., 2004), chronic cannabis users (Fridberg et al., 2010), heavy alcohol users(heavy drinkers)(Gullo & Stieger, 2011). Extensive set of research is focused around particular mental disabilities, e.g. Asperger's disorder(Johnson, Yechiam et al., 2006), psychopathic tendencies (Blair et al., 2001), bipolar disorder (Brambilla et al., 2012), schizophrenia (Martino et al., 2007), pathological gambling disorder (Cavedini et al., 2002), attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (Agay, Yechiam, et al., 2010). Most popular reinforcement learning models for identifying behavioural differences between different disorders are Expectancy Valence model (Busemeyer & Stout, 2002) and Prospect Valence Learning model (Ahn, Busemeyer, Wagenmakers & Stout, 2008).


################################# intro 


Decision-making is a cognitive process of selecting an option from a set of possible alternatives based on certain criteria \cite{Wang2007}. When analysing decision-making as a continuous process of interaction with the environment, learning becomes an important aspect. Learning is a complex procedure and can be described and estimated through different parameters. The learning procedure can be affected by different social and psychological conditions. Due to their cognitive ability people should show different learning behaviour.\\
One of the popular experiments for analysing decision behaviour is the Iowa Gambling Task. The decision making process is studied by monitoring peoples sequential choices in a controlled experiment environment.\\
In \textit{supervised learning} data are predicted by training a classifier based on examples. The identity of observations in the training sample is known. This is used to connect patterns in the data with corresponding labels of observations. In contrast to that in \textit{unsupervised learning} we don't know the ground truth. The objective is to discover natural clustering behaviour in the data itself and group objects into subsets, such that objects in those subsets are more closely related to each other \cite[page 9 et. seqq.]{Murphy2012} and \cite[page 501 et. seqq.]{hastie}. A vast class of clustering algorithms based on different approaches are proposed in the literature (e.g. hierarchical and optimization based clustering). This paper investigates, whether such unsupervised learning techniques can be used in the context of human decision making process to identify latent grouping. The decision making process is studied by monitoring peoples sequential choices in a controlled experiment environments over time. Thus, this paper operates in the intersection of machine learning and cognitive science. To our knowledge this particular setting has not been studied before.\\
We approach our research in the following way. We first set up a reinforcement learning based simulation framework to study theoretical boundaries of several clustering techniques and when they are applicable.
 Subsequently, we test our chosen methods on several  real experimental data sets. Corresponding to our simulation framework we first apply clustering algorithms to data from controlled n-armed bandit experiment.\footnote{A detailed introduction is given in section \ref{reinf}} A widely used approach to study human decision making process is the \textit{Iowa gambling task}, where participants try maximize rewards by choosing cards from different decks with different reward structures.\footnote{There are existing several slightly different versions of test. \cite{Steingroever2015} provides a data collection for from several sources giving a broad overview of different variations of the test.} Within this framework we analyse two different data sets. First we study decision making behaviour from people with different criminal profiles. Furthermore, we use another data set from cocaine abusers.\\


The report has the following structure. In section two we provide a short overview on related literature in the field. Section three is dedicated to the theoretical foundation and the simulation. We first provide knowledge of reinforcement and line out our experiment design in more detail. This section also includes an overview of applied algorithms, similarity and distance concepts. A mathematical formulation of the applied algorithms, similarity measures and cluster evaluation techniques can be found in the appendix.\footnote{Since our data are fairly small we will not discuss complexity of the algorithms.} Finally, we study their simulation performance and try to identify parameter settings, where they are applicable.\\ 
The rest of paper is address clustering our experimental data. We keep the scope of this paper tight and thus there some questions have to be left open. Thus we dedicated another section to discussing some possible extensions. We close this paper with a final summary of our results.
