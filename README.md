## Summary:

Modeling decision making process conventionally requires a decent amount of explorative work and expertise. 
The paper investigates, whether unsupervised learning techniques can be used to identify latent grouping within decision making data to simplify cognitive modelling.
In context of decision making, data are usually of the form of a sequence of choices from a set of n- discrete choice possibilities. 
In the first step we set up a reinforcement learning and multiarm bandit based simulation framework to study under which conditions unsupervised learning is applicable. 
This setting allowed us to control a wide range of parameters, such as learning rate, strength of explorative behaviour, true cluster sizes and bandit distribution.
In the following we studied clustering behaviour for real data sets of people in a multi-arm bandit setting, people with cocaine addiction and data from individuals with several criminal backgrounds.
